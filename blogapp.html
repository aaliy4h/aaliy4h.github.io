                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    This web application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts through a clean, 
                    user-friendly interface. 
                    In addition to standard blog features, users can like posts and comments, view other users' profiles, 
                    and interact through music uploads. 
                    The application is built using Laravel (a PHP framework) and utilizes AJAX to update content dynamically 
                    without full page reloads. 
                    It employs MySQL for data storage and Docker for containerisation, 
                    ensuring a consistent and isolated development environment. 
                    To simulate realistic content during development and testing, Faker is used to generate sample data.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the key focuses during development was ensuring web accessibility, 
                    which influenced both the design and implementation of the interface. 
                    The database schema was carefully designed first to provide a solid foundation for efficient data handling.
                    Working with AJAX presented a notable challenge, 
                    as handling asynchronous requests was unfamiliar to me and required a deep understanding of dynamic 
                    front-end interactions. 
                    Setting up a Docker environment for Laravel was also a learning experience â€” I had to get to grips with 
                    containerisation and configuring services like PHP, MySQL, and Nginx to work together seamlessly.
                    Finally, adapting to Laravel's conventions took time. 
                    Initially, the framework's structure was confusing, but through this project, 
                    I gained a much stronger understanding of MVC architecture and how to build scalable web applications.
