                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a task manager app designed specifically for the Apple Watch, aimed at supporting
                    individuals with ADHD.
                    Informed by user research involving 31 participants, the app was built with accessibility,
                    minimalism, and engagement in mind.
                    Gamified elements like unlockable achievements, confetti animations, and a playful
                    task-randomisation mechanic
                    (triggered by shaking your wrist) help make productivity more rewarding and enjoyable.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Designing for a small, glanceable interface like the Apple Watch was a key challenge.
                    It required prioritising simplicity and intuitive gestures while still supporting meaningful
                    functionality.
                    Balancing engagement with clarity was also important — gamified elements had to enhance motivation
                    without becoming distracting.
                    Gathering and analysing feedback from ADHD users helped shape the design, ensuring it was both
                    supportive and user-friendly.
