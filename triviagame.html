                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a Trivia Game for Android, developed in Kotlin using XML within Android Studio. 
                    It offers a wide range of questions across multiple categories, retrieved via a JSON-based API. 
                    Players can choose from several game modes, including Classic, Timed, and a custom Hangman mode.
                    To enhance engagement, the game includes a virtual pet that players can feed and interact with. 
                    In-game currency, earned by answering questions correctly, can be used to care for the pet. 
                    A statistics page allows users to track their performance over time, including games played, 
                    games won, and previous answers.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                   Designing and implementing the Hangman mode required integrating a unique mechanic into the core trivia 
                   experience while maintaining consistency and balance. 
                   Ensuring the pet feature added value without distracting from gameplay was also a key design challenge.
                   Integrating Firebase for authentication and real-time data storage introduced complexities related to 
                   asynchronous operations. 
                   Additionally, parsing JSON data from the trivia API involved handling varying structures to ensure 
                   reliable and seamless question generation.
