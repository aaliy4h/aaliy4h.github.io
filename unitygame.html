                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a top-down 2D game developed in Unity, 
                    where the player can move around a tilemap-based world, collect items, and engage in combat with hostile NPCs. 
                    The game features a drag-and-drop inventory system with a toolbar for quick access to items like potions, 
                    which can heal the player or grant temporary effects (e.g. increased speed).
                    Players earn points by defeating enemies and collecting items. 
                    NPCs follow preset paths during the first half of the in-game “day,” but become hostile in the second half. 
                    When hostile, they will deviate from their path to chase the player if they come within range, 
                    adding a strategic layer to movement and combat.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges was designing tilemaps with precise layering and collision mechanics, 
                    particularly for tiles that should partially obstruct the player. 
                    Implementing NPC pathfinding and dynamic hostility also required careful logic and tuning, 
                    especially to make transitions between passive and aggressive behaviour feel smooth and responsive.
                    Another significant hurdle was learning to work with Unity3D, 
                    as I had very little prior experience with the engine. 
                    I had to quickly get to grips with its structure — understanding where different components belong, 
                    how to manage scenes, and how Unity's event and scripting systems tie everything together. 
                    This learning curve was steep but rewarding, and it gave me a solid foundation in using Unity 
                    for 2D game development.
