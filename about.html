                <p>
                    I'm Aaliyah Shah, a Computer Science graduate from Swansea University, awarded First Class Honours.
                    I'm passionate about creating thoughtful, accessible, and user-focused software â€” from mobile apps
                    to web platforms.
                    Whether it's gamifying task management or designing engaging user experiences, I love building
                    things that make a real difference.

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I hold a First Class degree in Computer Science from Swansea University, and also studied the
                    subject at GCSE and A-level.
                    Throughout my studies, I've worked on a range of individual and group projects involving web,
                    mobile, and wearable apps.
                    These projects have deepened my understanding of user research, accessibility, gamification, and
                    user experience design.
                    I've used Agile and Scrum in collaborative settings, gaining experience in planning, communication,
                    and iterative development.
                    I also have hands-on experience with software testing, debugging, and continuous improvement.
